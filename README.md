# HexaBuild Training – HBT307: IPv6 Linux OS and Infoblox

Copyright 2026 - HexaBuild, Inc.

---

This is the repository for the *HBT307 IPv6 Linux OS and Infoblox* course.

Given time constraints, there is no formal user lab component to this course. Instead, the instructor will walk through a number of demonstration labs for both Linux and Infoblox NIOS. If you wish to run some of the commands shown in the demos, you'll need a lab with at least one or more of the included Linux distributions along with an instance of Infoblox NIOS. The [Lab Setup](lab-setup.md) document details the configuration of the [EVE-NG](https://eve-ng.net) lab the instructor uses. 
> 
> **Note**: The instructor lab includes full network connectivity to both the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet along with Infoblox NIOS and virtual router instances, which may not be practical for attendees to obtain and configure. Nevertheless, any available isolated instances of Linux and Infoblox NIOS may still allow attendees to run some of the commands shown in the demos.
