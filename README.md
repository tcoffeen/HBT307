This is the repository for the *HBT307 IPv6 Linux OS and Infoblox* course.



> **Important!**: Given time constraints, there is no formal user lab component to this course. Instead, the instructor will walk through a number of demonstration labs for both Linux and Infoblox NIOS. If you wish to follow along with the demos, you'll need a lab that includes one or more of the Linux distributions included along with an instance of Infoblox NIOS. The [Lab Setup](lab-setup.md) document details the configuration of the lab the instructor uses, including full network connectivity to both the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet, which may not be practical to build for most attendees.
